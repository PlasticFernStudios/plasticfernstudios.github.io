                <p class="med"> We donâ€™t look at QA as an afterthought but rather as a truly integral part of game dev. Our highly
experienced team has a very strong understanding of common game pitfalls and set the quality
bar for every project very high.
<br>
<br>
While many look at quality assurance testing in isolation, we look at each game from a integrated
perspective and strive to create the best user experience possible. We understand the needs of
every platform and communicate timelines, and requirements clearly and efficiently with you. </p>

        <p class="med" style= "color:white";>
          We've created a general timeline to help developers plan ahead and schedule accordingly for what they might need. Our services can start as early as the planning stages with developers, all the way through post-release and everything in between.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our flexibility and knowledge can be helpful for small, targeted sweeps as well as broad coverage, to help get your game where it needs to be, in the hands of players!
