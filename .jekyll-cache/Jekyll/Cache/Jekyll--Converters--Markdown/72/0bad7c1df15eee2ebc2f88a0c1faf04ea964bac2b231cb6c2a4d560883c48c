  <p><em>Itâ€™s hard to believe itâ€™s been 5 years already! Thatâ€™s right, Plastic  Fern Studios has been &gt;around for more than 5 years now working on some of the coolest games with some very cool people &gt;and weâ€™ve learned a ton (both good and bad) from these experiences and thought it would be worth &gt;sharing a few. I tried to pick some different aspects from development to how I run this company &gt;from a value standpoint and hope you find it interesting. Thanks for all the support!</em></p>
