<p>There are common misconceptions when it comes to a wide range of games services. Many folks think they aren’t needed, are too cost prohibitive, don’t need to be an integrative part of the game dev process, or are services that they can only get if working with a publisher. However, not only are most of these services essential in some form, they’re also services that you can have options with in terms of how you get them done.</p>
