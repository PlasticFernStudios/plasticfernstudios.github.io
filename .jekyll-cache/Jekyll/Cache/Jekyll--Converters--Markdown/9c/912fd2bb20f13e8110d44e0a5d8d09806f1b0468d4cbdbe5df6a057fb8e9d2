<p>Check out just some of the cool things we‚Äôve worked on since we opened! (With quite a few more to come!)

<p>Since many of our team have worked at a variety of places leading up to Plastic Fern Studios, we had a lot of thoughts about what did and didn‚Äôt work for us personally in past. We aimed to try something different and settled on a few key things. Mainly, we wanted to be sustainable and employee centered. This mean no ebb and flow of hiring/firing for projects, fair pay, benefits, and a focus on a work environment that feels safe and honest. It came with a few hurdles and a lot of people telling us ‚ÄúYou know you don‚Äôt legally have to do that‚Äù in an effort for us to ‚Äúsave costs‚Äù (at the expense of employee well-being in my opinion). Here are some key things about our studio:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We are completely remote, and have been since we started in 2018.</li>
  <li>We do not have set ‚Äúcore‚Äù hours though we do have natural overlap (and other async-based processes to compensate) but we let everyone work on their own schedule to fit their life.</li>
  <li>This gives people freedom to choose when working best suits their mood, schedule, or daily life and helps benefit both mental health and productivity. It also allows for taking care of things without having to take time off too, so that can be saved for more important things.</li>
  <li>In order to accomplish a remote/async setup like this there are a lot of processes in place to establish asynchronous collaboration. For example: we don‚Äôt do a lot of meetings and instead communicate via slack, scheduled messages, and post things with the expectation that those things might not get immediate attention.</li>
  <li>We operate with an understanding that everything is not always urgent/on fire and projects can still be released on time with this method!</li>
  <li>Accomplishing all of this also requires a good producer to be on top of things as well as a team to buy into those processes (plus good tools help). It also involves boundary setting and respecting other‚Äôs time and schedules.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What we try to keep in mind is that If something is SO important that someone else needs to answer it immediately, then a core process has failed somewhere and that needs to be addressed.</strong></p>
