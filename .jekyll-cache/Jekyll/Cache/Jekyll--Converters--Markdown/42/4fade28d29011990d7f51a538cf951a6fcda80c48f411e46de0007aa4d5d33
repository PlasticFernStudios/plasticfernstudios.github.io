<p>Another year completed! We worked on many exciting projects in 2022 but perhaps the <strong>most</strong> exciting thing is this year we had our first IRL meeting with everyone together in the same room, in person, in Portland (which was lovely!).</p>

<p>For 2023 we plan to continue offering our high level engineering and development services, quality assurance testing and processes management, release management, and audio programming/design help to more games!</p>
