  <p><em>It’s hard to believe it’s been 5 years already! That’s right, Plastic  Fern Studios has been around for more than 5 years now working on some of the coolest games with some very cool people and we’ve learned a ton (both good and bad) from these experiences and thought it would be worth sharing a few. I tried to pick some different aspects from development to how I run this company from a value standpoint and hope you find it interesting. Thanks for all the support!</em>
