<br />

Another year completed! We worked on many exciting projects in 2022 but perhaps the **most** exciting thing is this year we had our first IRL meeting with everyone together in the same room, in person, in Portland (which was lovely!).

For 2023 we plan to continue offering our high level engineering and development services, quality assurance testing and processes management, release management, and audio programming/design help to more games!
