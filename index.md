				<h2>Our Clients</h2>
				<p>We love working on great games with great teams! See what they have to say about us: </p>
				<ul>
				<li>The Plastic Fern folks are amazingly thorough, precise, and flexible. We've been super impressed! <b>- Jamie Cheng, Founder, Klei Entertainment</b></li>
					<li>We worked with Plastic Fern Studios at the end of EarthNight’s dev process and really wish we had known about them sooner. They helped us port to Switch, finalize PlayStation 4 and Steam builds and optimize the entire game... they seemed like members of the team who had been working in the project for years after only a few weeks. On top of clearly being technical wizards, the team was a pleasure to work with. We will unquestionably be using their services for future projects. <b>-Rich Siegel, Founder, Cleaversoft</b>
</li>
					<li>Plastic Fern provides highly experienced, intelligent, and responsive testers.  They jump right into the communication tools / databases our team uses and provide daily communication, giving our team with the support we need, on demand. <b>-Gavin Simon, Co-Founder, Supergiant Games</b></li>
